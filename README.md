# Project Requirements

### Task 1: Movie Poster Image
* Add at least 3 movie posters to the HTML (find readily available image choices linked below)

### Task 2: Movie Poster Resize
* Once you have the movie poster images in your HTML, use CSS to make the posters the same size and use flexbox to align them horizonatally across the page. Make sure each move poster has a unique border.

### Task 3: Movie Reviews
* Create an array of movie reviews for each movie. Using a loop and update reviews for each movie to the div with the class `movieReviews`. This loop should run when a user clicks on the movie image.

### Task 4: Cost Calculation
*When the user clicks on the "Calculate Total" button, calculate the total cost based on the number of tickets entered into the input fields: 
* Create a variable named `child` and set it equal to the number a user types into the input field with the class `numberChild` multiplied by the price of a child ticket ($8)
* Create a variable named `adult` and set it equal to the number a user types into the input field with the class `numberAdult` multiplied by the price of a child ticket ($12)
*Create a variable named `total` and set it equal to the variable `adult` + the variable `child`

### Task 5: Checkout
Use conditionals to display different messages depending on total cost in the div with the class `totalCost`:
* If total is less than 0 display, "You cannot select a negative number"
* If total  is equal to 0 display, "You did not select any tickets"
* If total  is more than 0 display, "Your total cost is" + the cost

### Bonus
